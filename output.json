    "description": "BASS CAMP Festival 2017 - Bangalore\n\nVENUE: The Humming Tree\nDATE: FRIDAY, 1st Dec 2017\nTIME: 9 PM on wards\nLine Up: Om Unit, Kutmah & More\nTickets: http://bit.ly/BassCamp17-Bangalore (EARLY BIRDS)\n\nIndia\u2019s only festival dedicated to bass-heavy sounds, Krunk\u2019s Bass Camp Festival 2017 is back with a 10-city festival in association with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey & Vh1 India.\n\n--------------------------------------\nAbout BASS CAMP Festival\n--------------------------------------\n\nFounded in Feb 2010, Bass Camp is India\u2019s first and only bass heavy electronic music festival, promoting cutting edge electronic music like drum n bass, dubstep, glitch hop, drumstep and more.\n\nBass Camp Festival is a KRUNK Property. You can find out more about KRUNK here: www.krunklive.com. KRUNK has pioneered the bass music movement in India for the last 7 years.\n\n--------------------\nAbout Om Unit\n--------------------\nAs a producer and DJ, Om Unit (Jim Coles) has been a significant and pioneering presence in various dance music circles for the past five years. Following a formative decade in the global hip-hop underground, Coles took the name Om Unit in the late 2000s and began to travel across genres and scenes in search of sonic tropes to cross-breed and re-imagine. In the early 2010s, he came to pioneer the stylistic and rhythmic links between jungle and footwork via a series of acclaimed edits that brought him to the attention of the drum & bass scene. This personal approach has earned Coles praise as a refreshing voice in dance music from both peers and the media. His debut album was, 2013\u2019s Threads, and he's worked with legendary drum & bass outfit Metalheadz, Machinedrum, Grammy-winning producer Om\u2019Mas Keith, Plastician\u2019s Terrorhythm, Sam Binga and more. In 2011, Coles set up a label, Cosmic Bridge Records, through which he has exercised an A&R sensibility that has created an exciting independent home for likeminded artists. Coles is also a sought after DJ, with over 300 appearances in clubs and festivals in more than 30 countries he has made the equivalent of over a dozen trips round the globe and counting. And in line with his desire to imagine new potentials for dance music has appeared on varied bills from the Montreux Jazz Festival to Bass Coast, Outlook to Mysteryland.\n\n----------------------\nAbout KUTMAH\n----------------------\nA mercurial creative, whether you\u2019re talking art or music. As a DJ/curator, he has tirelessly searched for and championed new underground talent from across the globe. His passion, hunger and most importantly, his incredible ear for new music have made him Flying Lotus\u2019 go-to warm-up DJ and also earned him the honour of compiling an album - \u201cKutmah presents Worldwide Family Vol.2\u201d - for Gilles Peterson\u2019s Brownswood Recordings in 2012. It brought to the fore Kutmah\u2019s gift for A&R, cemented when he founded his own label IZWID in 2013. In August 2017, he released his debut album \u201cThe Revenge Of Black Belly Button!\u201d (or TROBBB!), featuring an incredible cast of guests - Gonjasufi, Jonwayne, Natureboy Flako, Ta\u2019Raach, Jeremiah Jae, Zeroh, Zackey Force Funk, N8NOFACE, Sach, Akello G Light and DJ Chris P Cuts - spanning experimental meditative, Zennist loops; crackly oddball beats and abstract raps; as far as outright punk/noise and even folk/blues.\n\n-------------------\nThe Humming Tree\n-------------------\n Humming Tree is an arts, music and performance space in Bangalore, India, open since June 2013. At the present moment, along with major international artists who are touring with us, we're curating 25+ programmes a month including fantastic music gigs, fun workshops, film screenings, exhibitions, cultural performances, theatre, spoken word poetry, reading and storytelling sessions and other educational gatherings.
